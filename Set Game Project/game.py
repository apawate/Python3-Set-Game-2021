'''
Names: Agastya Pawate and Advaita Guruprasad 
Snapshot #1: Finished everything except playRound(), which is still pending and will hopefully be done by Friday...
Snapshot #2: Finished playRound() and achieved very basic functionality. The next step will be to get the scoring and rounds/games system in, which will require a lot of loops and stuff.
Snapshot #3: Actual functionality is achieved! I think it works fully now. *virtual high five to Advaita*
Snapshot #3a: Okay, now it works for real. The positioning bug deleted the wrong cards when a set was found, but I did some tricky debugging and managed to fix it.
Snapshot #4: Another submission to Web-CAT to see if the y/n bug has been fixed.
Snapshot #5: Fixed displayInRows and removed the playRound loop to make the code Web-CAT friendly.
Snapshot #6: Fixed the "n" bug so that it appends 3 cards again. (Indentation got messed up when removing the while loop.)
Snapshot #7: Fixed the bug that didn't allow the "asdf" command to execute properly. (I moved the routine to playSetGame.)
Snapshot #8: Hopefully this is the final death blow to the bugs that have plagued my Web-CAT submissions.
Snapshot #9: Okay, this one should really be the final blow. I changed the score variable from an int to an attribute of the player.
Snapshot #10: The code is completed! (But the nightmare bug lives on in realtime...)
